# Geocoding-with-Javascript
# Web Application Development Assignment

#Description below

For this assignment, you will design a client-side, browser only application that lets a user type a series of addresses into a text box. 
Each time they enter an address, you are will use JavaScript (you may utilize jQuery or axios)  to issue an AJAX request for the geocoding information. 
You will display a map (see below) and place a marker on the map corresponding to the location returned.  
Each address the user enters will be listed vertically on the right, youâ€™ll need to dynamically create the elements in JavaScript  
after adding them to the map.  As a final requirement, whenever the user clicks on one of the previous addresses listed on the right, 
the map should automatically center on that particular location. 
You will use Leafletjs (Links to an external site.) and MapBox (Links to an external site.) to make all this happen.
